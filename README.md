FeedGen generates RSS feeds for services that don't actually have them. This enables the user to get
updates on website/service content without checking it via clients or websites. For example, you can
get updates on Instagram posts from public profiles or new from a university website without
checking it.

## Usage

```sh
# Go to server dir
cd server
# Build the server
go build
# Run it
./server
```
